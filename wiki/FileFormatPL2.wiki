= PL2 File Format=
PL2 files are just pak files, they contain all the other files that PL2 uses.
The pak file format is simple, but unfortunately uses an odd compression system. At the moment this is unknown (although a tool called MltPL2.exe can decompress these files).

== Layout Overview ==
|| *Offset* || *Type*                    || *Description* ||
|| 00h      || {{{u32[4]}}}              || Always 0's? What is this for? ||
|| 10h      || {{{pl2PL2_Entry[]}}}      || Entries in the pak file ||


== pl2PL2_Entry ==
|| *Offset* || *Type*         || *Description* ||
|| 00h      || {{{char[32]}}} || Name of the entry ||
|| 20h      || {{{u32}}}      || Offset in bytes to start of file ||
|| 24h      || {{{u32}}}      || Size of packed data in bytes ||
|| 28h      || {{{u32}}}      || Size of unpacked data in bytes ||
|| 2Ch      || {{{u32}}}      || Padding ^???^ ||

== Data format ==
The data is not stored raw, even when uncompressed.
I can currently unpak uncompressed data, and will document how later on.
